# Hephaestus
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/-Q5EXDGnHX0>
#### Description:
    Hephaestus is just an example of a standard web scraping project. I developed this project due to a lack of time and a desire to have a social media presence with some followers and definitely few extra bucks would become handy for me. You can import pictures, descriptions, and URLs of goods from aliexpress.com using Hephaestus. Afterwards, log ins to your Pinterest account and starts creating Pins with the images, descriptions, and URLs scraped from aliexpress.com.
    Input instances is almost none. And the user might not know what they are doing wrong.
Lots of bugs in the code for example if one of the div elements is obscured by any other element, the code simple crashes. There's no handling scenerio for this.
There can be other features like checking the pins that already posted and editing them.
